# ðŸ”¬ In this project i have studied the electronic band structure of the graphene, the project is developed on Wolfram Mathematica.
# Projects:
## - Only Pi orbitals Graphene band structure
- [Wolfram Notbook only Pi]()
- [2D Immage of electronic structure only Pi]()
- [Image of the Density of States]()
## - Adding Sigma orbitals to the Band Structure
- [Wolfram Notbook sigma](https://github.com/zano97/Michele-Zanotti/blob/main/Physics%20Projects/Solid%20State%20Physics/Graphene%20sigma.nb)
- [3D Immage of the dispersion bands]()
- [2D Immage of electronic structure]()
